Installing cimr
===============

cimr requires Python :math:`\ge` 3.7.
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_ or
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ are convenient
options for scientific computing with Python. However, if a basic
Python version has been installed, requirements.txt and setup.py
files can be used to download specific packages required for cimr
functions.

cimr can be installed using pip3::

    pip3 install cimr


Or by cloning the git repository for the nightly builds::

    git clone https://github.com/greenelab/cimr.git
    cd cimr
    python3 setup.py build
    python3 setup.py install
